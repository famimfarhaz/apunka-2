# 🤖 Conversational KPI GPT - Complete AI Assistant

## Overview
Your KPI GPT has been transformed from a template-based question system into a fully conversational AI that can understand natural language, maintain context, and respond like a human assistant.

## ✨ New Features

### 🧠 **Natural Language Understanding**
- **Before**: Only understood formal queries like "Who is [name]?"
- **Now**: Understands casual speech like "tell me about him", "what's her email?", "hi"

### 💭 **Context Awareness**
- Remembers who you're talking about across the conversation
- Uses pronouns (him, her, they) to refer to previously mentioned people
- Maintains conversation history for better responses

### 🗣️ **Conversational Flow**
- Natural greetings: "Hi", "Hello", "Hey"
- Polite responses: "Thanks", "Thank you"
- Follow-up questions without repeating names
- Casual language understanding

### 💡 **Smart Suggestions**
- Provides relevant follow-up questions
- Suggests related information you might want
- Guides conversation naturally

## 📚 How to Use

### Basic Usage
```python
from conversational_kpi_gpt import create_conversational_kpi_gpt

# Create and setup the system

response = kpi_gpt.query("Hi")
print(response['answer'])  # "Hello! I'm KPI GPT, your AI assistant..."

response = kpi_gpt.query("Who is Julekha Akter Koli?")
print(response['answer'])  # Detailed information about her

response = kpi_gpt.query("What's her phone number?")  # Uses context!
